# lib/wz

`wz` is a library for reading WZ files, consisting of two major components:

* `wz::Wz`: a one-copy, zero-allocation, lazy, memory-mapping WZ reader,
* `wz::Vfs`: provides a "natural" view of the contents of a WZ file, built on a `wz::Wz`.

For background on the structure of WZ files, see the `WZ File Format` section below.
